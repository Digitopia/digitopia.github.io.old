<br/><p><small><em>ABSTRACT: Digital music making is evolving dramatically with today's increasing availability of free music software and musical content. Digitópia, a platform for collaborative music creation recently started at Casa da Música, Porto's main concert venue, addresses how these trends can affect generalized music creation and music software design, promote social inclusion, and lead to the emergence of multicultural communities of music makers/lovers. In this paper, we report on the musical activities conducted in the first months of existence of Digitópia, and highlight some developments for the future.

<br/><p><small><em>INTRODUCTION: Some of the most interesting recent developments in music are related to the fact that ordinary computers and mobile devices acquired capabilities to make, record, store and spread music, while becoming available to a greater number of people. An 'active relationship' with music is nowadays within the reach of people that did not go through the process of formal musical education, due to an increasing number of software applications that allow creating and making music in a friendly and intuitive manner. We are witnessing a true worldwide revolution in the way we create, perform, spread, listen and learn music. The project Digitópia - Platform for the Development of Digital Music Communities - [1][2] aims to explore these surges of development in a facility implemented in Casa da Música ́s main entrance hall, which will contribute: 1) to develop music and creativity amongst a range of ages and social conditions, and mostly amongst youth; 2) to foster the development of free music software; 3) to promote social inclusion, and lead to the emergence of multicultural communities of music makers/lovers; 4) to promote free musical content.

<br/><p><small><em>ABSTRACT: In this paper we present the main ideas that shape musical experiences in the context of the Education Service program at Casa da Música, Porto and analyze how computers, applications and technology in general are part of a strategy that aims to provide a broad access to music making. A particular emphasis is given to technologies that have been purposely developed in order to fulfil particular needs of our program. We describe how a technologically enhanced musical education culture is emerging and how Factor E, the resident educators team of CdM, is constantly setting up new challenges that lead to innovative practices and to the development of new tools and artifacts.

Developing musical skills at Digitópia

Abstract
In this paper we briefly present Digitópia and analyze how this environment catalyzes the development of communities around the creation of digital music. We describe how the exchange of knowledge and skills amongst users, as well as between the facilitators and the users, happens naturally and in a very informal manner, present some specific cases worth mentioning and further explain the paths we developed to nurture this environment of knowledge exchange.

uTubo — development and application of an alternative digital musical instrument

Abstract
This article describes the development and use of uTubo, a sound device planned to be neither a musical toy nor a “serious” instrument. The device, built using the Arduino platform to synthesize sound and read gesture data from a few coupled sensors, allows the instrument player to interact with the sound generating unit mainly by twisting/bending a plastic tube. Furthermore it is also possible to invert this interaction by clicking a big button on the top of the casing, changing the way input gestures are used to produce sound, which can substantially alter the relationship between the instrumentalist and the device.
uTubo was one of the instruments built for the project Sonópia, which proposed to create a set of novel instruments and interfaces developed by Digitópia Collective - Casa da Música and LAbMóvel - Gulbenkian Foundation, during March 2013. Sonópia was part of Ao Alcance de Todos, meaning by the reach of all, which was a larger group of projects with artistic and social scopes, led by Serviço Educativo da Casa da Música. And for this purpose, uTubo was designed for no specific person or type of person, aspiring to suit a large range of players, from people with certain degrees of physical/mental impairments to children or even “serious” musicians.

Sonorium - The Transformation of Movement into Musical Gesture in a New Virtual Interface (Case Study)
<br>
Abstract
Sonorium is a virtual musical instrument that interprets the performers/ participants’ position in a physical space, inviting free body expression and the creation of spontaneous choreographies that result in musical compositions. The software, makes use of a MS Kinect camera to map a tridimensional space into sound, allowing users to musically interact and compose, individually or in groups, using the space and their bodies’ movement as a mean for musical creativity.
